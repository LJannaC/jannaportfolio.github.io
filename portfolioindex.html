<h2 align="center" style="font-family:Monospace"> Hello! My name is Janna Carmona from 9-Family. </h2>
<p style="font-family:Monospace"> My name is Lady Janna E. Carmona, Also known as 'Janna' or 'LJ', and this is my <b/>Quarter 1 S.Y.2024-2025 TLE-ICT E-portfolio</b/>. Get to know me better in my grade 9 years!
<br/> <br/>
So far, This has been my favourite year in LPSCI. Not only are my teachers great and cool; My classmates have never felt this united before. I can actually have fun, be happy, and be myself!
<br/> <br/>
In this quarter in ICT-TLE, I've met the infamous Ms. Uminga. I've met her before from the NLCA and I knew she was going to be fun to be a subject teacher. She (and Sir Kinji) have been great lecturers to me as I've understood what they teach most of the time.
<br> <br>
My grades, I reflect, are not that great. But since I have close friends and classmates, I'm not that shy to ask for any assistance anymore.
<br/> <br/>
I have learned many things new about HTML, Things that are helpful for creating a website on my own. With practice since Grade 8; It has been quite an amazing journey. I've learned how to code with XHTML, How to nest, How to make tables and lists, and how to create a form.
